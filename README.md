# Professional Self-Assessment
This repository includes artifacts and documents to showcase my skills and abilities in the following key categories:
- Software Design and Engineering
- Algorithms and Data Structure
- Databases
At the beginning of this course, I was tasked with identifying and selecting three artifacts from previous coursework that I would like to enhance. Those original artifacts are included in this portfolio. Next, I performed an intial code review to provide a detailed walkthrough of the existing features and functionality of the code, as well as discuss my planned enhancements. Over the next several weeks, I followed my planned approach to complete all of my proposed enhancements. The resulting enhancement artifacts are included in this portfolio to showcase my expertise in these three areas of Computer Science.
There are five course outcomes applicable to this course:
1. Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.

In my enhancement work for Software Design and Engineering, I included in my in-line comments a detailed description of the code and functionality. Developers work as a team, and it is important that we collaborate with each other on our code. Comments and code reviews are a vital part of collaboration for developers, and read me files within GitHub can be important to business analysts to gain understanding about the code and its purpose.

2. Design, develop and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.
  
For my login and user authentication enhancement, I employed strategies that illustrate this course outcome. First, I utilized red font to make the verbiage stand out to the user on the page. I utilized clear, concise language to instruct the user what they need to do to log in. This provides a better experience for the user.

3. Design and evaluate computing solutions that sovle a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer scinece practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.
  
For my user dashboard enhancements under the Algorithms and Data Structures item, I had many enhancements available for selection. I carefully selected page enhancements that provided the most value to a user and chose not to utilize any options that would negatively impact the performance of the page, or the usability. For example, I could easily have added the ability to view all records from a query, but that could severely impact the page performance. If too many records were returned the page could potentially crash or become very slow. It would also be difficult or unpleasant for the user to scroll through too much on the screen.

4. Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.

In my user dashboard enhancement, I utilized innovate techniques for the user interface. The purpose of this database is to locate animals that meet multiple search criteria. I added functionality to sort multiple columns at once and enabled filtering by column. This is important functionality for the users to easily identify animals that meet their search criteria.

5. Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.

My enhancement for the user dashboard includes a user login and authentication. This enhancement demonstrates my ability to recognize that data needs to be protected and user authentication is necessary for protection of a database. Additionally, I utilized hashing to protect the storage of user entered passwords.

# Code Review
[Code Review Video](CodeReview.mp4)
In this video, I discuss the original artifacts prior to any enhancements. I explain how the code currently works and why I selected the item for enhancement. The code review focuses on the following details:
- Existing functionality: I provide a detailed walkthrough of the current features and functionality of the code, prior to any enhancements.
- Code Analysis: I identify areas which need improvement including structure, efficiency, security, and code commenting.
- Planned enhancements: I discuss my planned enhancements that will be utilized to demonstrate my abilities within Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structure, and Databases.

# Software Design and Engineering
[Original Artifact](animal_shelter.py)

[Enhancement Artifact](Main.java)

My original artifact is an Animal Shelter Python class, which includes the functions of Create, Read, Update, and Delete. To demonstrate my ability to write programming logic in multiple code languages, I have created the same Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality utilizing the Java programming language. 

# Algorithms and Data Structure
[Original Artifact](ProjectTwoDashboard.ipynb)

[Enhancement Artifact](RevisedDashboardCS340.py)

My original artifact is a dashboard user interface, which is utilized by users to interact with the Mongo Database records. To demonstrate my abilty to utilize innovative sills and techniques to improve the overall user experience, I selected this artifact for ehancement. I modified the programming of the dashboard to enhance the user experience by adding important items such as a start page, setting the view to 10 for optimal viewing, and pagination.

# Databases
[Original Artifact](ProjectTwoDashboard.ipynb)

[Enhancement Artifact](RevisedDashboardWithAuthenticationCS340.py)

My original artifact is a dashboard user interface, which is utilized by users to interact with the Mongo Database records. The original artifact includes a hard coded username and password, allowing any user to easily gain access to the Database. I selected this item to demonstrate my anticipation of adversarial exploits, and security mindset. I implemented a user login and authentication process. Additionally, I included hashing to securely store the user passwords.
